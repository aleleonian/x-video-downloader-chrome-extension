# Twitter Video Downloader - Chrome Extension

## 🚀 About the Project
This Chrome extension adds a **⬇️** button to tweets containing videos on X (formerly Twitter). When clicked, it sends the tweet URL and user authentication cookies to a backend server, which downloads the video using `yt-dlp` and provides a direct download link. Users can configure the backend server, either using the default one or setting up their own.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Adds a **⬇️** button to tweets with videos.  
✅ Automatically fetches X cookies for authentication.  
✅ Sends tweet URL and cookies to a backend for processing.  
✅ Users can configure their own backend or use the default one.  
✅ Uses `yt-dlp` on the server to fetch and serve the video.  
✅ Deletes temporary files after download to keep things clean.

## 📦 Installation

### 1️⃣ **Load the Extension in Chrome**
1. Download the latest release ZIP from [https://github.com/aleleonian/x-video-downloader-chrome-extension/releases/](#) _(or build manually - see below)_.
2. Extract the ZIP.
3. Open **Chrome** and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
5. Click **Load Unpacked** and select the extracted folder.
6. The extension should now be installed!

### 2️⃣ **Backend Setup (Node.js Server)**
The backend server is responsible for downloading the videos.
This extension requires a **backend server** to fetch and serve videos.

#### ✅ **Option 1: Use the Default Backend**
By default, the extension uses:

http://149.56.12.157:3000

No setup required! Just install the extension and start downloading.

---

#### 🔧 **Option 2: Run Your Own Backend**
If you prefer to use your own server, you can set it up in **a few minutes**.

1. **Download the backend from GitHub**  

https://github.com/aleleonian/x-video-downloader-chrome-extension.git

#### **Prerequisites:**
- Node.js installed.
- `yt-dlp` installed (`pip install yt-dlp`).

#### 2. **Run the Server:**
```sh
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```
_(Make sure you update `.env` including data for these variables: HOST_ADDRESS, PORT. The contents of HOST_ADDRESS is the host where the backend is going to run on. If you're running it on your machine, it's localhost. PORT is the port where the app will be listening to. Defaults to 3003.)_


3. **Set the backend in the extension settings**:  
- Click the extension icon in Chrome.
- Enter `http://localhost:3000`.
- Click **Save**.

---

## 🚀 **Final Thoughts**
- You can always **switch back to the default backend** by clearing the input field in the settings.
- Running your own backend **gives you full control over your downloads**.

## ⚙️ Development & Build Process
If you want to modify the extension, follow these steps:

### 🛠 Development Setup
1. Edit files inside the `src/` directory.
2. Use `console.log()` freely for debugging.
3. Run `node build.js` to create a production-ready extension.

### 🏗 Production Build
Before publishing, remove debugging logs and update server addresses.
```sh
node build.js
```
This will:
✅ Remove `console.log()` statements.  
✅ Replace `localhost` with the production server IP.  
✅ Copy files into a `dist/` folder.  
✅ Generate a `.zip` ready for upload.
